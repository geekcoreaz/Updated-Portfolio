                    <p>
                        I was born in Los Angeles and spent the first 17 years of my life there. I moved to Tucson in 1994
                        and
                        completed my senior year of high school in 1995. For roughly the past 20 years I have worked in IT
                        both for companies like AOL and Square Enix as well as being self employed. In April 2017, I
                        started working a vape shop in Tucson and I can honestly say I'm the happiest working there,
                        although
                        I still continue to do IT work on the side. I want to continue to develop skills with Full Stack
                        Development and I plan on making it a career in a couple of years.

                        My main hobbies include playing games and listening to music. I particularily like playing games
                        on
                        PC,
                        though I do have both a PlayStation 4 and and an XBox One. I also enjoy playing Dungeons and
                        Dragons.
                        My latest hobby obsession has been buying bluetooth speakers and headphones/earbuds. I've purchased
                        8
                        of them in the past few months.
